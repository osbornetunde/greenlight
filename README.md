# Greenlight API

## Local Development

This section covers running the API locally for development (with or without Docker), database setup, and developer tooling.

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+ (or the version declared in go.mod)
- PostgreSQL 14+ (local install or via Docker/Compose)
- Make (optional but recommended)
- curl (optional, for quick API tests)

### Environment variables
Create a `.env` file or export variables in your shell:
- DATABASE_URL: Postgres connection string (e.g. postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/greenlight?sslmode=disable)
- SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_PASSWORD (if using mailer for activation emails)
- PORT: API port (default 4000)
- CORS_TRUSTED_ORIGINS: space-separated list of trusted origins (optional in dev)

### Running locally with Go
1. Install dependencies:
   go mod download
2. Set required env variables (see above).
3. Run the server:
   go run ./cmd/api
4. Visit:
   http://localhost:4000/v1/healthcheck

### Using Makefile (if available)
Common targets:
- make run: Run the API locally
- make test: Run tests
- make build: Build the binary
- make tidy: Go mod tidy and vendor updates

### Database migrations
If you manage migrations manually, run your migration tool to apply files in migrations/. Ensure your DATABASE_URL points to your development database.


## Docker Deployment

This project includes a Dockerfile for containerized deployment. The Dockerfile:

1. Builds the application in a Go environment
2. Creates a minimal runtime image with only the necessary dependencies
3. Sets up the application to run with proper permissions
4. Configures environment variables for deployment

### Building the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t greenlight-api .
```

### Running the Docker Container Locally

```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 -e DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string greenlight-api
```

### Deploying with Railway

When deploying to Railway, the platform will automatically:
1. Detect the Dockerfile and build the image
2. Set up the necessary environment variables
3. Deploy the container with the appropriate configuration

Make sure to set the DATABASE_URL environment variable in your Railway project to connect to your PostgreSQL database.

## How to Deploy to Railway.com (Like You're 5 Years Old)

Hello friend! Let's put our Greenlight app on the internet using Railway.com! It's like building a LEGO tower and showing it to everyone!

### Step 1: Get Ready
1. Ask a grown-up to help you make an account on [Railway.com](https://railway.com)
2. Install Railway on your computer:
   ```
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```
3. Login to Railway:
   ```
   railway login
   ```

### Step 2: Connect Your Project
1. Go to your Greenlight folder on your computer
2. Tell Railway about your project:
   ```
   railway init
   ```
3. When it asks questions, just pick the options that make sense to you!

### Step 3: Add a Database
1. In the Railway website, click on "New Project"
2. Click "Provision PostgreSQL"
3. This gives your app a special place to store information, like a toy box!

### Step 4: Connect Your App to the Database
1. In the Railway website, go to your project
2. Click on the PostgreSQL database
3. Look for "Connect" and copy the "DATABASE_URL"
4. Go back to your project settings
5. Click on "Variables"
6. Make sure there's a variable called "DATABASE_URL" with the value you copied

### Step 5: Send Your App to Railway
1. Go back to your computer
2. Make sure you're in your Greenlight folder
3. Tell Railway to take your app:
   ```
   railway up
   ```
4. Wait while Railway builds your app (like putting together a puzzle!)

### Step 6: Tell Everyone About Your App
1. In the Railway website, go to your project
2. Click on "Settings" and then "Generate Domain"
3. Railway will give your app a special address on the internet
4. Now you can share this address with your friends!

### Step 7: Check If Your App Is Working
1. Visit your app's address in a web browser
2. Add "/v1/healthcheck" to the end of the address
3. If you see a happy message, your app is working! Hooray!

That's it! You've put your app on the internet, just like a real programmer! ðŸŽ‰

## API Documentation

### Base URL
```
http://localhost:4000/v1
```

### Authentication
Most endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. Include the token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
```

### Permission System
The API uses a permission-based system with two main permissions:
- `movies:read` - Required to view movies
- `movies:write` - Required to create, update, or delete movies

New users automatically receive `movies:read` permission upon registration.

### Content Type
All requests and responses use `application/json` content type.

}
```

### Rate Limit Error Response (429)
```json

```

---

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse:
- **Default limit:** 2 requests per second
- **Burst capacity:** 4 requests
- Rate limiting can be disabled in development mode

When rate limit is exceeded, the API returns a 429 status code.

---

## CORS

The API supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Configure trusted origins using the `cors-trusted-origins` flag when starting the server.

---

## Example Usage

### Complete Authentication Flow

1. **Register a new user:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/v1/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword123"
  }'
```

2. **Activate account** (use token from email):
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:4000/v1/users/activated \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "token": "ACTIVATION_TOKEN_FROM_EMAIL"
  }'
```

3. **Get authentication token:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/v1/tokens/authentication \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword123"
  }'
```

4. **Use token to access protected endpoints:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/v1/movies \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### Create a Movie
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/v1/movies \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "title": "The Matrix",
    "year": 1999,
    "runtime": "136 mins",
    "genres": ["action", "sci-fi"]
  }'
```

### Search Movies
```bash
curl "http://localhost:4000/v1/movies?title=matrix&genres=sci-fi&sort=-year" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```
